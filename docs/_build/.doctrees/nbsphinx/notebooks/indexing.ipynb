    "Now you have a nice indexing solution, and you can use the resulting stream file for merging. However, you might be able to do better, by using the more sophisticated pre-processed images, which should be available by now. E.g. you can try different effective exposure times in the cumulative data sets, and see which trade-off between signal and radiation damage gives the most pleasant results.\n",

The indexing result will always be the same, as it is derived from the peaks stored in the HDF5 files, but still take long to compute. If this is a problem for your data, for more information/hacky workarounds, please contact `robert.buecker@mpsd.mpg.de`. For this example data set, we fortunately know already, that cumulating to frame 4 gives the best result. So let's do that.\n",
